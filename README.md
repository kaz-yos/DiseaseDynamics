DiseaseDynamics
===============

This is my current project to use R, Shiny, and deSolve and create simple ODE models for disease dynamics (e.g., SIR, SEIR). 
The other projects (BasicSIR, BasicSEIR, OpenSEIR) were all starting points to get familiar with Shiny, but this project should replace them in both functionality and priority.
To see the code in action, go to: See the code in action at: http://spark.rstudio.com/mkiang/DiseaseDynamics/

Once I've finalized the code and incorporated as many features as reasonable, I'll put up a blog post with detailed descriptions of the models.
